# MEP
This repo holds contains code to create a DB in mysql and then populate that db with energy data. This includes pulling data from pertinent websites. The first website that I am working on is the CENACE website. 
Anything labeled MEP referes to the Mexican Energy Project wich is what I am calling this initial data harvesting and analysis piece. The goal is to maintain an on going data harvest and then analyse the data to find trends and forecast prices in Mexico in both the Day Ahead and Real Time market.
